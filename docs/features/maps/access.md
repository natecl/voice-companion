# Tester access and account controls

Feature ID: `access` · Context reviewed September 29, 2026 against main `3a30e25`.

## Purpose and user outcome

Independent per-tester enrollment, isolation and revocation. Product direction: **AI notes that proactively contribute to discussions**. Canonical [product](../../product-source-of-truth.md) and [engineering](../../engineering-principles.md) guidance govern this map.

## Current implementation

Internal credential, admission, quotas and administration foundations exist. Single-instance service startup owns migrations and interruption recovery.

## Gaps and non-goals

Independent invited-tester enrollment and public account operations are not established. Sign-up/account UI can contain previews. Full account/memory erasure is not delivered.

## Flow and implementation entry points

Native credential/enrollment → authenticated admission → owner-scoped service/ledger → revocation/sign-out.

## Contracts and dependencies

No provider secrets in source or app bundle; no shared production credentials among testers. Separate owner isolation, authorization, budget reservations and permission to deploy. Sign-out must invalidate owner-scoped local state.

**Uses:** None required in this map.

**Consumers / coordinated work:** [Capture and live transcript](capture.md), [Recording library and sync](library.md), [Companion chat and follow-ups](chat.md), [On-device note caching](note-cache.md), [TestFlight install and update](distribution.md)

These links describe integration boundaries, not a mandatory execution order. The worker packet assigns exact file ownership; listing a shared file here does not authorize concurrent edits.

## Verification and delivery state

- Repository state: internal foundation; independent beta readiness unverified.
- [Feature verifier contract](../verification/access.json): `python3 scripts/verify_feature.py access`.
- [Mechanical baseline and unresolved checks](../verification-map.md#initial-mechanical-check-results--september-29-2026). Automated success is not full-feature acceptance.
- Required real-path evidence: Actual authenticated service paths with two isolated users and revocation; Fresh enrollment, sign-out/data clearing and actionable failure UI.
- Merged/deployed/installed are separate states. This map is a repository context audit; it does not freshly inspect hosted flags or the phone. Historical evidence below applies only to its recorded versions and scenarios. Obtain actual version/configuration identities before a runtime claim.

## Next bounded work

Audit and select the smallest private-pilot enrollment path; prove fresh access, two-user isolation and revocation before distribution.

Before editing, read this map and linked code, identify affected contracts, and define observable success/failure cases in the packet. Submit changed behavior, exact commit/configuration, reproducible evidence, remaining gaps and proposed map updates to the orchestrator. Dependent work waits for explicit review acceptance.

## Supporting context and evidence

- [execution/demo-testflight-phases.md](../../execution/demo-testflight-phases.md)

## Maintenance

Update this map when behavior, dependencies, verification, deployment evidence or the next blocker changes. Update the linked catalog/verifier with it. Preserve failed evidence and label superseded experiments; do not append contradictory status updates or replace missing verification with a claim of completion.
